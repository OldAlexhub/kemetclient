            Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city and a major economic hub, is
            located on the Mediterranean Sea's southern coast. Founded by
            Alexander the Great in 331 BC, it has a rich history that blends
            Greek, Roman, and Egyptian influences, making it a unique cultural
            melting pot. Historically, it was home to the Lighthouse of
            Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the
            Great Library of Alexandria, the largest library of the ancient
            world. Today, Alexandria is known for its historical landmarks,
            beautiful beaches, and vibrant cosmopolitan atmosphere.
